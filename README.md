This is code for a friend's art project.

The idea is that first someone would play tetris for a few minutes, with `keylogger.py` running in the background. This saves the player's moves into `keylog.txt`. They would then open photoshop and setup a shortcut so `?` opens the foreground colour picker, set the brush size to 10px, and make a new document. They then run `draw.py` and follow the instructions and wait. The script will read `keylog.txt` and do something depending on the key.
